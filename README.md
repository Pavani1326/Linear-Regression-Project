# Linear-Regression-Project
To predict the Heart attack disease for organization WHO(World Health Organization),using Machine Learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner

# Problem Statement:
## A World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 12 millions then records.One of them half of the dead result is found in US.The research scholar point out the most relevant risk factor of        As a data science Engineering predict the overall risk using Machine Learning algorith called as Logistic Regression.
# TASK-1
## Import the libraries which is required for prediction.
# TASK-2
## Import the dataset using work space.    
# TASK-3
## Use a appropriate argument of sklearn library to train,test and split the data sets.
# TASK-4
## fit your values with arrange function with feature scalling.
# TASK-5
## check your model accuracy and precition using confution matrix

###n Conclusion:
According to the model analysis the LogisticRegression algorithm works successfully with range 0.6 accuracy.
The accuracy shows that building the model is a successfull
